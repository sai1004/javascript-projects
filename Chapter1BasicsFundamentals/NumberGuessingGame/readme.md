**Number Guessing Game**

---

### 🎯 Objective:
To build a game where the user guesses a randomly generated number within a range. The game provides feedback and tracks attempts until the user guesses correctly.

---

### 🧩 Functional Requirements:

1. **Random Number Generation**:
   - Generate a random number between a specified range (e.g., 1 to 100) when the game starts.

2. **Input Field**:
   - User can input a guess (number).

3. **Submit Button**:
   - A button to submit the guess.

4. **Feedback to User**:
   - Display messages:
     - “Too high”
     - “Too low”
     - “Correct!”

5. **Attempt Counter**:
   - Show number of attempts taken.

6. **Game Over Message**:
   - Display when the user guesses correctly.
   - Optionally, show after a maximum number of attempts (e.g., 10 tries).

7. **Restart Button**:
   - Restart the game with a new random number and reset input and attempts.
